This challenge explored the cities with the ideal weather condition and locate the closest hotels in those cities. In WeatherPy, we randomly generated numbers for latitudes and longitude and identified the city name using citipy. Then, we collected the weather data from OpenWeather API and examined the relationship between latitude and different weather conditions (including temperature, cloudiness, wind speed and humidity). Scatter plots were generated by using matplotlib. In VacationPy, we set up an ideal weather condition from data collected from OpenWeather API, and located the closest hotels in those cities. The location of the hotels were plotted on a map using geoviews and hvplot.
